# Filesystem

Filesystem is a package which allow users to perform high-level disk
operations simply and easily. This package was created in an attempt to
eliminate all the annoying code associated with file system calls (which
inevitably end up being duplicated between projects anyway).

# Features

* A wide variety of common filesystem operations are available!
* All methods are abstracted out to be as simple to use as possible!
* All methods are obviously labeled, straight forward, and as self-explanatory as possible!
* No need to remember/learn yet another set of basic filesystem calls for a new language!
